How to run: just use “python ccpro21.py” command in the terminal or shell

Question2 
m1.small has 1093 rps on average and it costs 4.4 cents an hour. 
so rps/cents = 1093*60*60/4.4=894273

m1.medium has 2469 rps on average and it costs 8.7 cents an hour. 
so rps/cents = 2469*60*60/8.7=1021655

m1.large has 4579 rps on average and it costs 17.5 cents an hour. 
so rps/cents = 4579*60*60/17.5=941966

Question 3
Power Consumption (W) = (Peak Consumption - Idle Consumption)*CPUUtilization + Idle Consumption

CPUUtilization of m1.small = (100+98.67+100+100)/4=99.67

PC=(120-80)*99.67/100+80=120


CPUUtilization of m1.medium = (100+98.83+98.85+100)/4=99.42

PC=(180-120)*99.42/100+120=180

CPUUtilization of m1.large = (100+98.67+100+100)/4=80.645

PC=(240-180)*80.645/100+180=228

Question 8

Y = 1130

X =3632
Y/X=0.311
