The answers of Question2, 3, 6, 8 are in the view log web page.

I use m3.medium instance. Observing the healthy host in the monitoring of ELB, I can find that there are only one consecutive 5-min when I use 3 instances. So the answer of Question 4 is, 20Hour * 4 instances - 1 = 79 instance-hours

The answer of Question7 is: the earnings at the end of the test minus instance-cost
= 6.56 - 79*0.07 = 1.03
